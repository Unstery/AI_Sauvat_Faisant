## AI Project - Image to text description

The AI project is located in the `TP3-8` folder. This project contains 2 Notebooks for each created model, as well as the 2 datasets we used to train our model.

The first Notebook `exercice3_image_to_text.ipynb` contains the model we created, while the second Notebook `exercice3_fine_tuning.ipynb` corresponds to the fine-tuned model.

The 2 datasets, `flickr8k` and `FoodImages`, used are stored in the `kaggle/input/` folder and the saved models are in the `kaggle/working/` folder.

In addition, you will find the details of our project as well as the techniques tested in the written report: `AI_report_Sauvat_Faisant.pdf`

## Authors

This project was carried out in pairs by Bastien Sauvat and Bastien Faisant.
